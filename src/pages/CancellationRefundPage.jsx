          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This Cancellation and Refund Policy governs all payments made for participation in Madooza, organized by IMAGICITY,
            Hazaribagh, Jharkhand. It applies to all ticket holders, stall vendors, and cosplay event participants. By making a
            payment or registering for Madooza, you agree to these terms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Ticket Purchases</h2>
          <p>All general entry tickets purchased online through official Madooza platforms are final, non-refundable, and non-transferable.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Once a ticket is booked, no cancellation or refund will be permitted for any reason, including change of plans, travel delays, or non-attendance.</li>
            <li>Tickets cannot be transferred, exchanged, or used for any other event.</li>
            <li>Any ticket obtained through unauthorized sources will be considered invalid.</li>
            <li>Lost, stolen, or damaged tickets will not be replaced.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Reason:</strong> All infrastructure, venue arrangements, artist coordination, and event logistics are confirmed based on advance ticket sales. Hence, refunds or cancellations are not feasible once the booking is completed.

          <h2>Stall and Vendor Cancellations</h2>
